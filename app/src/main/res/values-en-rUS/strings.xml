    <string name="title1">MilkUp Goat Kefir</string>
    <string name="article1">This super delicious kefir comes from Goat\'s Milk which is grass fed and real grains. The natural, fresh and delicious taste is what sets our Goat Kefir apart from the others. This product tastes bland, so you can add a sweetener of your choice. This kefir tastes sour and tangy, like aerated feta.
        \nWe carefully cultivate grass-fed goat milk from around the farm with a diet filled with organic bacteria and fresh grains, resulting in a smooth and light drink with billions of good probiotics per serving. As it is made from goat\'s milk, our Goat Kefir is suitable for those who cannot enjoy cow\'s milk based products.</string>
